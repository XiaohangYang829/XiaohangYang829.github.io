<b>I will move to <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/">UCLA Computer Science</a> early next and admit new PhD/MS students in UCLA for fall 2022. If you are interested in joining my group, please apply <a href="https://www.cs.ucla.edu/graduate-admissions/">here</a>. See <a href="projects/">projects</a> and <a href="publications">publications</a> for the research focuses in my group. </b>

I study interpretable human-AI interaction for computer vision and machine autonomy. I am interested in understanding various human-centric properties of AI models beyond the accuracy, such as <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">explainability</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">interpretability</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/higan/">steerability</a>, <a href="https://decisionforce.github.io/pgdrive/">generalization</a>, <a href="https://genforce.github.io/fairgen/">fairness and bias</a>. 

Some of the earlier works I co-authored are <a href="http://cnnlocalization.csail.mit.edu/">Class Activation Mapping (CAM)</a>, <a href="http://places2.csail.mit.edu/">Places</a>, <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/">ADE20K</a>, <a href="http://netdissect.csail.mit.edu/">Network Dissection</a>.
